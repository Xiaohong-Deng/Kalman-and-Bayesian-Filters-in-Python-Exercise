# Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python-Exercise
## Dependencies
To run the code it requires all the dependencies listed in [Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python][0]. Some of the dependencies are bundled with the book itself.

## Motive
Nobody wants to write code in the browser. PyCharm and Atom + hydrogen are the alternatives. PyCharm need virtual environments to work with Jupyter notebook and as of 3/25/2018 `filterpy` doesn't play well with virtual environments, at least it's the case on Windows. That leaves Atom + Hydrogen. The combination allows you to write Jupyter style code in `.py` file, while you can enjoy the interactiveness that Jupyter notebook has. That's good because for code exercises I don't need too much text.
